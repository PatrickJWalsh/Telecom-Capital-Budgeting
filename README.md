# Telecom-Capital-Budgeting
This document serves to summarize the project scope and output from our engagement with a leading telecom company as part of the Opex Forecasting efforts.






## Project Scope
We were engaged by a leading telecom company to develop a solution that could forecast cash and Opex within the cell-site network over the next 3 years at the site-level of granularity.  In doing so, we would accomplish the following:

•	Guide operational decision-making and proactively address potential budget risks by providing target financial performance metrics 

•	(Prior to this, the budget was managed centrally (national team), and targets did not exist at the market (local) levels, so local decision makers had a lack of accountability around operational decisions and their financial trade-offs)
•	Compare Current project plan with alternative scenarios to identify savings opportunities
o	Varied build / decommission schedule
o	Different tower configurations
o	Vendor Selection (lease and backhaul)
•	Define business requirements and UX Design for full-scale solution through Proof of Concept
o	Historical Cost Coverage including ~10 cost areas within the network
o	Target Budget at the market level for the next 3 years
o	Ability to incorporate “What-if” (scenario) analysis based on common parameters (individual & bulk entry)
o	API integration with existing systems

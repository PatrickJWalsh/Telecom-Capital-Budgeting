# Telecom-Capital-Budgeting
This document serves to summarize the project scope and output from our engagement with a leading telecom company as part of the Opex Forecasting efforts.






## Project Scope
We were engaged by a leading telecom company to develop a solution that could forecast cash and Opex within the cell-site network over the next 3 years at the site-level of granularity.  In doing so, we would accomplish the following:

**- Guide operational decision-making and proactively address potential budget risks by providing target financial performance metrics **
  - Prior to this, the budget was managed centrally (national team), and targets did not exist at the market (local) levels, so local decision makers had a lack of accountability around operational decisions and their financial trade-offs

- Compare Current project plan with alternative scenarios to identify savings opportunities
  - Varied build / decommission schedule
  -	Different tower configurations
  -	Vendor Selection (lease and backhaul)

- Define business requirements and UX Design for full-scale solution through Proof of Concept
  - Historical Cost Coverage including ~10 cost areas within the network
  - Target Budget at the market level for the next 3 years
  - Ability to incorporate “What-if” (scenario) analysis based on common parameters (individual & bulk entry)
  - API integration with existing systems

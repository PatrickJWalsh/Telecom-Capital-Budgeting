# Telecom-Capital-Budgeting
This document serves to summarize the project scope and output from our engagement with a leading telecom company as part of the Opex Forecasting efforts.






## Project Scope
We were engaged by a leading telecom company to develop a solution that could forecast cash and Opex within the cell-site network over the next 3 years at the site-level of granularity.  In doing so, we would accomplish the following:

- **Guide operational decision-making and proactively address potential budget risks by providing target financial performance metrics**
  - Prior to this, the budget was managed centrally (national team), and targets did not exist at the market (local) levels, so local decision makers had a lack of accountability around operational decisions and their financial trade-offs

- **Compare Current project plan with alternative scenarios to identify savings opportunities**
  - Varied build / decommission schedule
  -	Different tower configurations
  -	Vendor Selection (lease and backhaul)

- **Define business requirements and UX Design for full-scale solution through Proof of Concept**
  - Solution needs to have 2 years of historical costs including ~10 cost areas within the network
  - Target Budget needs to exist at the market level for the next 3 years
  - Users need the ability to incorporate “What-if” (scenario) analysis based on common parameters (individual & bulk entry)
  - API integration with existing systems must be available


## Collaboration & Personnel Involved
We Collaborated across various groups within the client’s organization to complete this project, including:

- Met with personnel from lease, backhaul, utilities, roaming, and R&M teams to gather data and to align on forecasting methodology
- Worked with Client’s Analytics team to understand SQL database for relevant datasets (planned projects within the network)
- Teamed with finance personnel to determine appropriate target setting methodology for regions and markets
- Interviewed market and regional directors (future end users) to socialize the proof of concept, refine use cases, and to define the functional requirements for the full solution
- Communicated with client core team to track progress, escalate issues, and to discuss potential off the shelf solutions for full-scale implementation
